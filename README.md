Network Architecture Overview
This repository outlines a decentralized network design focused on global synchronization, jurisdiction-specific data handling, and incentive-driven node participation. The architecture ensures data localization compliance (e.g., for regions like the EU) while maintaining performance and security through proofs, challenges, and economic mechanisms.
Key Components:

Global L0 Network: Acts as the backbone for connecting all L1 clusters, enabling global peer connections and synchronization.
Enforce Localization: Applications query and restrict data sharing based on IP/jurisdiction filters, using trust models to route gossip/P2P communications.
Jurisdiction-Specific L1 Cluster (e.g., EU): Contains regional nodes with self-attestation for storage capacity. Includes incentive designs:

Staking: Nodes stake NET collateral to boost selection odds and trust scores.
Rewards: Earn NET for honest performance, block/snapshot contributions, high storage, virality, and issue reporting.
Penalties: Slash NET for dishonesty, failed challenges, or low trust, potentially ejecting nodes.


Prove Storage Capacity: Nodes report signed capacity, respond to storage/retrieval challenges, and apps verify via SDK with optional ZK proofs.
Prove Localization: Uses signed snapshots embedding node details and ZK STARK proofs to confirm data jurisdiction.

The system leverages signed operations, consensus rounds, and historical audits for robustness.
